**Git** is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project while keeping a detailed history of changes.

- **Key Features of Git:**
    
    - **Distributed System:** Every user has a complete local copy of the repository.
    - **Version Tracking:** Tracks file changes, additions, and deletions over time.
    - **Branching and Merging:** Facilitates parallel development by allowing developers to create independent branches and later merge them.
    - **Speed and Efficiency:** Performs operations locally, making it faster than centralized systems.

In GitHub, a **fork** is a personal copy of someone else's repository that lives under your account.

---

### üîÅ In Simple Terms:

**Forking = Copying a repo to your own GitHub account.**

This allows you to:

- Experiment freely without affecting the original repo.
    
- Propose changes to the original by creating a **pull request**.
    
- Contribute to open-source projects.

### üì¶ What Happens When You Fork?

When you fork a repository:

- You get a **complete copy** of the code, branches, commits, issues (optionally), etc.
    
- It remains **linked** to the original repo (called the "upstream").
    
- You can pull updates from upstream or submit pull requests to contribute back.

### üëá Typical Use Case:

1. You fork a popular open-source project.
    
2. You make changes in your copy (fork).
    
3. You submit a **pull request** to suggest your changes to the original project.

### üìå Fork vs Clone:

| Fork                                         | Clone                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Happens on **GitHub**                        | Happens on your **local machine**    |
| Creates a copy under **your GitHub account** | Copies the repo to your **computer** |
| Good for contributing to public projects     | Good for working locally             |
